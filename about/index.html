            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="about-section">
                <p>I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for building reliable, scalable ML systems that solve real-world problems. My work sits at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and product development, where I help translate research insights into production systems that create value for users and businesses.</p>

                <p>Currently, I focus on MLOps, data infrastructure, and the practical challenges of deploying machine learning at scale. I believe that the most impactful ML work happens not in research papers, but in the unglamorous details of data pipelines, monitoring systems, and production reliability.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>I've had the privilege of working across various domains, from early-stage startups to enterprise organizations, tackling challenges in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ML Platform Engineering:</strong> Building infrastructure that enables data scientists to move from prototype to production quickly and safely</li>
                <li><strong>Production ML Systems:</strong> Designing and operating machine learning systems that serve millions of predictions daily</li>
                <li><strong>Data Quality & Monitoring:</strong> Implementing systems that catch data and model issues before they impact users</li>
                <li><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Leading cross-functional teams and mentoring engineers transitioning into ML roles</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
            <p>I'm particularly interested in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MLOps & Infrastructure:</strong> Making machine learning more reliable and accessible through better tooling and practices</li>
                <li><strong>Data Engineering:</strong> Building robust pipelines that ensure high-quality data flows from source to model</li>
                <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Developing systems that provide visibility into model behavior and performance in production</li>
                <li><strong>Applied Research:</strong> Bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical implementation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Writing & Speaking</h3>
            <p>I write about machine learning, data engineering, and the practical challenges of building ML systems. My goal is to share lessons learned from real-world deployments and help others avoid the pitfalls I've encountered.</p>

            <p>Topics I frequently explore include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Production ML deployment strategies and lessons learned</li>
                <li>Data quality frameworks and monitoring approaches</li>
                <li>MLOps tooling and best practices</li>
                <li>Technical book reviews and learning resources</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Background & Education</h3>
            <p>My journey into machine learning began with a background in software engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in building reliable systems. This experience has been invaluable in approaching ML challenges with a production-first mindset.</p>

            <p>I'm a continuous learner who believes that the field of machine learning is evolving so rapidly that staying current requires constant engagement with new research, tools, and practices. I regularly contribute to open source projects and participate in the ML engineering community.</p>

            <h3>Beyond Work</h3>
            <p>When I'm not building ML systems or writing about them, you might find me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading technical books and research papers (check out my <a href="../books/">book reviews</a>)</li>
                <li>Contributing to open source ML tools and libraries</li>
                <li>Mentoring aspiring data scientists and ML engineers</li>
                <li>Exploring new programming languages and frameworks</li>
                <li>Hiking and spending time outdoors to balance screen time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
            <p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow practitioners, discussing challenging problems, and exploring collaboration opportunities. Whether you're dealing with a tricky production ML issue, looking for advice on career transitions, or just want to chat about the latest developments in the field, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
